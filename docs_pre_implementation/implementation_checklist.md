# LibraryAI Implementation Checklist

This file is the execution ledger for the project.
It must be updated after every completed phase.
A phase must never be marked complete if any item in its Definition of Done remains unmet.

## Phases

### ☑ Phase 0 — Repo, containers, skeletons

- ☑ Packet 0.1 — repository structure and root files
- ☑ Packet 0.2 — docker-compose and service bootstrapping
- ☑ Packet 0.3 — shared health, metrics, logging, middleware
- ☑ Packet 0.4 — API and model service skeleton entrypoints
- ☑ Packet 0.5 — GPU backend local HTTP stub
- ☑ Packet 0.6 — service skeletons for worker, recovery, and maintenance processes

- **Summary:** Repo structure, all containers, all service skeletons, shared utilities, GPU backend abstraction, and implementation ledger are complete.
- **Blocked/blocking:** None. Phase 1 may begin.
- **Relevant spec constraints:** PYTHONPATH=/app in all containers (Section 1.5); Redis AOF enabled; IEP services are mock only until Phase 12.

### ☑ Phase 1 — Schemas, DB, storage, Redis, job API

- ☑ Packet 1.1 — UCF and preprocessing schemas
- ☑ Packet 1.2 — geometry, normalization, iep1d, layout schemas
- ☑ Packet 1.3 — EEP schemas and terminal page states
- ☑ Packet 1.3a — page state machine contract
- ☑ Packet 1.4 — storage backends
- ☑ Packet 1.5 — core DB migration
- ☑ Packet 1.6 — ORM / DB model layer
- ☑ Packet 1.7 — Redis queue setup
- ☑ Packet 1.7a — reliable Redis queue contract
- ☑ Packet 1.7b — presigned upload endpoint
- ☑ Packet 1.8 — job creation endpoint
- ☑ Packet 1.9 — job status endpoint

- **Summary:** All schemas (UCF, preprocessing, geometry, normalization, EEP, page states), Alembic migration, SQLAlchemy ORM, local+S3 storage backends, Redis queue contract, presigned upload endpoint, job creation endpoint (POST /v1/jobs), and job status endpoint (GET /v1/jobs/{job_id}) are complete and fully tested (819 tests pass).
- **Blocked/blocking:** None. Phase 2 may begin.
- **Relevant spec constraints:** DB is source of truth; Redis is execution mechanism only. DB committed before Redis enqueue; Packet 4.7 recovery re-enqueues orphaned tasks. `ptiff_qa_pending` is non-terminal (job stays `running`). Split-parent pages (status=`split`) excluded from job status derivation.

### ☑ Phase 2 — IEP1A/B mocks + IEP1C

- ☑ Packet 2.1 — IEP1A mock service shell
- ☑ Packet 2.2 — IEP1A TTA mock behavior
- ☑ Packet 2.3 — IEP1B mock service shell
- ☑ Packet 2.4 — IEP1B TTA mock behavior
- ☑ Packet 2.5 — normalization core
- ☑ Packet 2.6 — split handling
- ☑ Packet 2.7 — quality metrics

- **Summary:** IEP1A and IEP1B mock services (configurable via env vars: page count, confidence, TTA agreement/variance, failure simulation) return real `GeometryResponse` objects. IEP1C normalization is fully real: perspective correction from quadrilateral corners (`four_point_transform`), affine bbox fallback (`apply_affine_deskew`), split normalization (`split_and_normalize`), and four quality metrics (`blur_score`, `border_score`, `foreground_coverage`, `skew_residual`). `normalize_result_to_branch_response` assembles the canonical `PreprocessBranchResponse` from a completed `NormalizeResult` plus caller-supplied `source_model` and `processed_image_uri` (available only after Phase 3 selection and Phase 4 storage write). All 142 Phase 2 tests pass (65 IEP1A contract + 65 IEP1B contract + 62 normalization + 35 quality + 33 split + 12 branch-response adapter = 1325 total suite passing).
- **Blocked/blocking:** None. Phase 3 may begin (and is already complete).
- **Relevant spec constraints:** IEP1A and IEP1B are mock only until Phase 12 (Section 1.3); real ML inference is stubbed but all endpoints, schemas, and TTA contracts are real. IEP1C is fully real production code (Section 2.1). `normalize_single_page` returns `NormalizeResult` (contains numpy array; cannot be a Pydantic model); `normalize_result_to_branch_response` produces `PreprocessBranchResponse` once storage URI and source model are known. `split_confidence = min(weakest_instance_confidence, tta_structural_agreement_rate)` per spec Section 6.8.

### ☑ Phase 3 — Geometry selection + artifact validation

- ☑ Packet 3.1 — structural agreement and sanity checks
- ☑ Packet 3.2 — split confidence, variance, page area preference
- ☑ Packet 3.3 — final selection and route-to-human logic
- ☑ Packet 3.4 — artifact hard requirements
- ☑ Packet 3.5 — artifact soft score and threshold logic
- ☑ Packet 3.6 — gate test suite

- **Summary:** Geometry selection gate (structural agreement, sanity checks, split confidence, TTA variance, page area preference, confidence-based selection, route-to-human logic) and artifact validation gate (five hard requirements, six-signal weighted soft scoring, gate log record builders) are complete and fully tested (35 integration tests + 81 artifact tests + 114 geometry tests = 230 tests pass).
- **Blocked/blocking:** None. Phase 4 may begin.
- **Relevant spec constraints:** Spec Sections 6.8–6.9; geometry trust HIGH only when both models present + structural agreement + zero dropouts; route_decision never equals "failed"; soft scoring skipped when any hard check fails.
